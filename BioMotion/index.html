      <p>Welcome to the BioMotion study.</p>
      <p>Once the study has started, you will see a series of humanoid point light displays (PLDs) begin walking towards you and vanish after a few seconds.</p>
      <p> When each PLD vanishes, indicate which direction (relative to you) you think the PLD was going to turn in before it vanished, using the <kbd>&leftarrow;</kbd>, <kbd>&rightarrow;</kbd>, <kbd>&uparrow;</kbd>, and <kbd>&downarrow;</kbd> keys.</p>
      <p>For example, if you think the PLD was turning to your right just before it vanished, press the <kbd>&rightarrow;</kbd> key once it's gone. If you think it was heading right towards you, press either the <kbd>&uparrow;</kbd> or <kbd>&downarrow;</kbd> keys.</p>
      <p>The controls are also shown on the study display for quick reference.</p>
      <p>To begin the study, press <kbd>SPACE</kbd>.</p>
