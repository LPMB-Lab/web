      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the virtual reality (VR) maze environment! You, as a participant, will engage in a total of three (3)
        different tasks during this ~30-minute session: a familiarisation task, a navigation task, and an estimation
        task.
      </p>

      <em>YOU ARE WELCOME TO DISCONTINUE THE STUDY AT ANY TIME, WITH NO REPERCUSSIONS.</em>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <p>
        The tasks will not begin until you complete the setup &mdash; a simple process of entering your participant ID
        into a text field &mdash; which you can do by pressing the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing the setup, you will be prompted to press <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to start the familiarisation task.
      </p>

      <h3>Familiarisation Task</h3>

      <p>
        The familiarisation task is your opportunity to become familiar with the structure of the maze and with
        navigating through the environment using your mouse and keyboard. Controls are displayed at the bottom right of
        the program window.
      </p>
      <p>
        The arrow keys on your keyboard will enable you to maneuver and explore the VR environment, and clicking and
        dragging with your mouse will rotate your view.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this task will end automatically after 5 minutes, you can move onto the next task earlier than that by
        pressing <kbd>ENTER</kbd> or <kbd>RETURN</kbd>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the task has finished, you will be prompted to press <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to begin the navigation task.
      </p>

      <h3>Navigation Task</h3>

      <p>
        There are eight (8) navigation trials.
      </p>
      <p>
        In each one, you will start at one of four (4) predetermined starting
        locations, and will be tasked with locating an object (which will be indicated on the program window) in the
        maze as quickly as you can.
      </p>
      <p>
        The target object will be a guitar, a cactus, a cabinet, a lamp post, a cat statue, or
        a clock.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon moving close to the target object, all objects in the maze and the maze itself will disappear, and you will
        be transported to the starting location of the next navigation trial. This will continue until all the
        navigation trials are complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon completion of the navigation task, you will be prompted to press <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to start the estimation
        task.
      </p>

      <h3>Estimation Task</h3>

      <p>
        There are twelve (12) estimation trials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to the navigation task, in each estimation trial, you will start at one of four (4) predetermined
        starting locations, and will be tasked with locating an object (which will be indicated on the program window)
        in the maze as quickly as you can.
      </p>
      <p>
        The target object will be a guitar, a cactus, a cabinet, a lamp post, a cat statue, or
        a clock.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this time, upon moving close to the target object, all objects in the maze and the maze itself will
        disappear, and you will have to navigate to where you think you started the trial. Once you are confident in
        your location, press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> or <kbd>RETURN</kbd> to end the trial.This will continue until all the
        navigation trials are complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon completion of the estimation task, the program will end.
